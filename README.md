Description:
The task is to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether text expresses a positive or negative opinion.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify reviews based on sentiment.
The dataset contains customer review text along with labels (positive or negative).
Text preprocessing is performed to clean and normalize the reviews, such as converting text to lowercase and removing unnecessary spaces or symbols.
The reviews are converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization. TF-IDF gives higher importance to meaningful words and lower importance to common words.
The machine learning model used is Logistic Regression, which is suitable for binary classification problems.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
The model performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. For small datasets, some metrics may be undefined or low, but the process still demonstrates the workflow.
The task demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of sentiment analysis: loading data, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction, evaluation, and analysis.
The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook showcasing all these steps along with a short analysis of the results.
This task helps learners understand NLP concepts, text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning classification in a practical way.
